<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Scaling LLMs by Logical Consistency via Polytomous IRT
hypothesis: >-
  Large language model reasoning capability can be estimated without any frozen held-out test set or ground-truth answer key
  by (i) dynamically generating Metamorphic Item Clusters (MICs) — small families of prompts whose correct answers are bound
  by a logical relation that does not require computing the seed answer (e.g., a paraphrase, a negation, and a contrapositive
  whose oracles follow from the form of the question alone), (ii) measuring each model's logical coherence across each cluster
  as an ordinal response, and (iii) fitting a Samejima Graded Response Model (GRM) to recover a per-model latent ability θ
  that is meaningfully more predictive of published benchmark accuracy than simpler binary consistency metrics (paraphrase
  agreement rate, negation invariance rate) operating on the same clusters, on a panel of at least 15 public LLMs across four
  reasoning domains (propositional syllogisms, arithmetic word problems, multi-hop reading comprehension, and first-order
  logic), and that decreases under a realistic contamination simulation in which seed answers are injected into the model
  prompt (rather than only into the response matrix) and the model is re-queried, while static seed accuracy rises. The hypothesis
  is falsified if: (a) the GRM θ on the expanded panel fails to exceed the simpler consistency baselines by a margin that
  is statistically distinguishable given a 10,000-resample bootstrap CI, (b) under realistic contamination, θ fails to drop
  on a within-model comparison with the clean baseline (sign-flipped from Validation B in iteration 1), or (c) the contamination-resistance
  signal is not robust to adding the paraphrase/negation/contrapositive variants as part of the injected answer key (the 'natural
  contamination' test).
motivation: >-
  Static benchmarks are rapidly becoming contaminated as LLMs are trained on massive web crawls containing test questions
  and answer keys. Evaluating LLMs on static, frozen test sets creates a false impression of reasoning ability when models
  have actually just memorized the correct answers. A reference-free, dynamic evaluation framework that measures internal
  logical coherence across systematic perturbations removes the need for frozen benchmarks, remains immune to direct memorization,
  and offers a robust, psychometrically grounded estimate of genuine reasoning capabilities.
assumptions:
- >-
  A model's capability to reason is intrinsically linked to its ability to maintain logical consistency under semantic perturbations
  and structural transformations.
- >-
  The logical relations within a metamorphic cluster can be formally defined and verified without requiring a ground-truth
  answer key.
- >-
  A polytomous Item Response Theory model, such as the Graded Response Model, can successfully scale model ability and cluster
  properties even under relatively small model sample sizes by leveraging high item counts.
investigation_approach: >-
  We will design and implement Metamorphic Item Response Theory (M-IRT). First, we will build a dynamic generator that constructs
  Metamorphic Item Clusters (MICs) for logical reasoning and mathematical tasks. Each MIC contains a seed question, a semantic
  paraphrase, a negation, and a contrapositive. Second, we will evaluate a suite of public LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude
  3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Qwen 2.5) on these clusters, recording their answers. Third, we will evaluate pairwise logical consistency
  among answers in each cluster to compute an ordinal coherence score (e.g., 0, 1, 2) for each model-item pair. Fourth, we
  will fit a Graded Response Model (GRM) to these coherence scores using Expectation-Maximization to estimate each model's
  latent ability (\theta), alongside cluster difficulty (\beta) and discrimination (\alpha). Finally, we will validate M-IRT
  by correlating \theta with static benchmark scores (MMLU, GSM8K) and demonstrating its contamination resistance by intentionally
  injecting memorized answers into a model's simulated response profile and showing that its M-IRT score drops while its static
  correctness score rises.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) the latent ability (\theta) estimated by the reference-free M-IRT framework achieves
  a high Pearson correlation (r > 0.85) with clean, non-contaminated static benchmarks; (2) under simulated benchmark contamination
  (memorizing the answer key to specific questions while failing on metamorphic variants), the target model's static score
  increases while its M-IRT latent capability (\theta) remains stable or decreases due to broken consistency; and (3) the
  estimated item parameters (\alpha, \beta) exhibit stable convergence and intuitive difficulty orderings (e.g., complex multi-step
  logical contrapositives are scaled as higher difficulty than simple paraphrases).
related_works:
- >-
  ATLAS (Adaptive Testing for LLM Ability Scoring) (Adaptive Testing for LLM Evaluation, arXiv:2511.04689) uses computerized
  adaptive testing based on Item Response Theory to estimate model capability. However, it requires a pre-calibrated, static
  item bank with known ground-truth correctness, leaving it vulnerable to contamination and reference dependencies. M-IRT
  is completely reference-free and dynamic, evaluating consistency across metamorphic clusters instead of correctness against
  an answer key.
- >-
  Diagnosing the Reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge via Item Response Theory (arXiv:2602.00521) applies the Graded Response Model
  to assess the reliability of LLM judges. However, it evaluates judges against human ground-truth annotations and does not
  address the problem of evaluating the underlying reasoning abilities of models without frozen answer keys. M-IRT applies
  polytomous IRT to the target model's own logical coherence on generated items, bypassing the need for human gold labels.
- >-
  Rethinking Large Language Model Benchmarking with Item Response Theory (Lost in Benchmarks?, arXiv:2505.15055) and tinyBenchmarks
  (arXiv:2402.14992) use IRT to optimize and scale standard benchmarks, but they operate entirely on static datasets with
  fixed ground-truth correct answers. M-IRT reformulates the item response variable as logical coherence, enabling psychometric
  scaling on dynamically generated, reference-free item pools.
inspiration: >-
  This hypothesis is inspired by combining Metamorphic Testing from software engineering (which verifies program correctness
  by checking relations between inputs and outputs rather than checking against a hardcoded expected output) with Polytomous
  Item Response Theory from psychometrics (which models multi-category, ordinal response behaviors). By translating the software
  concept of metamorphic relations into logical consistency criteria across a cluster of questions, we can treat coherence
  as an ordinal 'item response' and apply psychometric scaling to extract a model's latent trait of logical reasoning without
  ever requiring a trusted answer key.
terms:
- term: Metamorphic Item Cluster (MIC)
  definition: >-
    A set of logically related questions generated on-the-fly (e.g., a statement, its negation, its contrapositive) whose
    correct answers are mathematically or logically bound by predefined relations, enabling consistency checking without knowing
    the absolute correct answers.
- term: Graded Response Model (GRM)
  definition: >-
    A polytomous Item Response Theory (IRT) model designed for ordinal, multi-category response data, used here to model a
    model's level of logical coherence on a metamorphic item cluster.
- term: Logical Coherence
  definition: >-
    The degree to which an LLM's responses across a metamorphic cluster satisfy the expected logical relations (e.g., answering
    consistently on both an implication and its contrapositive).
- term: Reference-Free Evaluation
  definition: >-
    An evaluation paradigm that measures model capabilities without relying on a gold-standard, human-annotated ground-truth
    answer key.
summary: >-
  We propose Metamorphic Item Response Theory (M-IRT), a ground-truth-free, reference-free evaluation framework that estimates
  LLM reasoning capabilities by checking their logical coherence across dynamically generated metamorphic item clusters and
  scaling the results using polytomous psychometrics.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same idea (consistency + IRT) with sharper scope and stronger evidence bar after reviewer critiques
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Distinguish from prior consistency literature (Liu et al. 2024, Jang et al. 2022, ConsistencyGate 2026) by making the GRM
  scaling layer the primary contribution, with explicit ablation against paraphrase agreement rate and negation invariance
  rate on the same clusters
- >-
  Raise the model panel floor from n=5 to n>=15 public LLMs across families (closed and open-weights, small and large), to
  give Pearson r, Spearman ρ, and Kendall's τ meaningful bootstrap CIs that do not collapse to [0.59, 1.0]
- >-
  Add two additional domain generators (multi-hop reading comprehension with paraphrase/negation clusters, first-order logic
  with quantifier-shift clusters) so the MIC bank covers four reasoning domains rather than two
- >-
  Constrain the arithmetic generator so the negation/inverse oracle is derivable from the question text alone (e.g., 'Is the
  answer greater than the first quantity?' rather than 'Is the answer NOT the seed answer?'), preserving the reference-free
  claim for arithmetic
- >-
  Redesign the contamination simulation as 'natural contamination': inject the seed oracle into the system prompt for a chosen
  subset of clusters, re-query the model on all four variants of those clusters, and check whether coherence rises on paraphrase/negation/contrapositive
  (which would defeat M-IRT) or stays low (which validates M-IRT). The previous 'overwrite the response matrix' version tested
  an artificial inconsistency, not a realistic memorization scenario
- >-
  Justify the K=3 ordinal mapping explicitly (the raw-count 2 bin captures 'coherent on half the variants', which is the smallest
  signal that the model is reasoning rather than guessing) and add a K=2/3/4/5 AIC/BIC comparison
- >-
  Replace the headline r=0.975 framing with a relative-validity framing: GRM θ vs paraphrase agreement vs negation invariance,
  reported with rank-based statistics (Spearman ρ, Kendall's τ) and leave-one-out analyses
- >-
  Reframe the contamination-resistance claim as a within-model Δθ comparison rather than an absolute-θ claim, because a 5-person
  GRM fit has only 5 degrees of freedom for θ and small perturbations shift θ visibly
- >-
  Acknowledge that the MMLU/HELM correlation tests only the syllogistic+arithmetic+reading+FOL component of reasoning capability
  that the MIC bank actually probes, and that extrapolation to other MMLU domains is a scope limitation rather than a validation

type: research
objective: >-
  Update the iteration-1 research_report.md to address the reviewer-mandated novelty positioning: add a 'Reference-free consistency
  as a research thread' paragraph that surveys and cites Liu et al. 2024 ('Aligning with Logic: Measuring, Evaluating and
  Improving Logical Preference Consistency in LLMs', arXiv:2410.02205 — explicitly proposes negation invariance as a reference-free
  property and validates it against MMLU), Jang et al. 2022 (introduced negational/symmetric/transitive consistency for LLMs),
  Novikova et al. 2025 (arXiv:2505.00268 — consistency survey), and ConsistencyGate 2026 (arXiv:2607.22962 — operationalises
  self-consistency as a contamination gate). For each, extract: (i) what consistency property they measure, (ii) whether they
  require a ground-truth answer key, (iii) whether they test contamination, (iv) what their strongest reported correlation
  with model quality is. Make the M-IRT contribution precise: (i) M-IRT uses a polytomous GRM rather than binary invariance
  indicators, (ii) M-IRT dynamically generates clusters per session so no item appears in any prior training corpus, whereas
  prior consistency work uses fixed prompts, (iii) M-IRT targets contamination-resistance specifically — natural contamination
  via system-prompt injection + re-query — whereas prior consistency work targets reliability/robustness. Also verify each
  arXiv ID and venue claim from the paper (arXiv:2602.00521, arXiv:2505.15055 AAAI 2026, arXiv:2402.14992, arXiv:2505.00268,
  arXiv:2607.22962, arXiv:2511.04689, arXiv:2406.04244) and flag any future-dated IDs or incorrect venue assignments. Add
  a 'natural contamination' methodology section that cites Sainz et al. (TS-Guessing), Xu et al. (contamination taxonomy survey),
  and HELM's contamination framing as the precedent for M-IRT's system-prompt-injection protocol. Recommend the cleanest citation
  language for the paper's Section 2 and supply a draft 'Reference-free consistency as a research thread' paragraph the paper
  can drop in directly.
approach: >-
  Use the aii-web-tools and aii-semscholar-bib skills to (a) search for and verify Liu et al. 2024 (arXiv:2410.02205) and
  Jang et al. 2022 via scholarly web search, (b) verify Novikova et al. 2025 (arXiv:2505.00268) and ConsistencyGate 2026 (arXiv:2607.22962),
  (c) confirm the publication venue for each existing reference (especially the 2025/2026-dated ones the reviewer flagged),
  and (d) locate any additional prior consistency-evaluation papers the reviewer did not name but that materially strengthen
  the related-work. Produce research_report.md (updated, ~4500 words) with three new sections — (i) 'Reference-free consistency
  as a research thread' (the paragraph the reviewer asked for), (ii) 'Natural contamination methodology' (the precedent for
  the system-prompt-injection protocol), (iii) 'Verification log' (every cited arXiv ID and venue cross-checked). Produce
  research_out.json with structured answer, 20+ sources (8 new), and 5 follow-up questions for the next iteration. The 'distinguishing
  M-IRT' bullets — polytomous vs binary, dynamic generation vs fixed prompts, contamination-resistance target vs reliability/robustness
  target — must be the spine of the novelty paragraph.

  Research artifact for M-IRT (Metamorphic Item Response Theory), a reference-free, contamination-resilient LLM evaluation
  framework. The artifact produced (i) `research_report.md` — a 3500-word structured synthesis positioning M-IRT against ATLAS,
  Lost-in-Benchmarks / PSN-IRT, tinyBenchmarks, and GRM-for-LLM-Judges; specifying a 4-grade Samejima GRM with Bock-Aitkin
  EM and Gauss-Hermite quadrature settings; defining a 5-step contamination-simulation protocol that mirrors Sainz et al.'s
  TS-Guessing and HELM's contamination framing; recommending an MR set (paraphrase, negation, contrapositive, distractor)
  backed by LGMT and LLMORPH precedent; and proposing four reasoning-domain sub-generators mirroring PrOntoQA, GSM8K/MAWPS,
  FOLIO, and LogicBench — and (ii) `research_out.json` — a structured JSON deliverable with an executive answer, 16 cited
  sources with verbatim quotes, and 7 follow-up questions.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.

GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-05 12:42:09 UTC

```
Direction: LLM Evaluation Foundations — Evaluation Without Frozen Held-Out Test Sets. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that questions whether trustworthy evaluation still requires a frozen held-out test set in the benchmark-contamination era, designs alternatives (dynamically generated probes, item-response-theory scaling, self-consistency audits), and validates them against established static benchmarks on public models.

Ambition: level 5 of 5 — groundbreaking science: invert an 'obvious' axiom of the field (the frozen held-out test set) and rebuild evaluation on a different foundation, with evidence strong enough to carry that claim.

Reviewer: I am Percy Liang (Stanford). Calibrate from my existing papers (HELM, foundation-model evaluation). Cross-domain ideas (psychometrics, item-response theory, survey methodology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks or ICLR main track. Audience: ML evaluation researchers. Tone: statistically careful, contamination-aware, reproducible on public benchmarks.
```

---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

1. **DOI/ArXiv refs** → batched into POST /paper/batch calls (up to 500 per API call, auto-chunked)
2. **Title-only refs** → individual GET /paper/search/match (1s delay between)
3. **Post-process** → fix entry type, fix citation key (AuthorYYYY), inject DOI

The ability server runs a single worker (`max_threads: 1`). Multiple concurrent tool calls are queued — each runs independently (no cross-request aggregation). Batching happens within each request.

### Input format

```json
{
  "references": [
    {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
    {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
    {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
  ]
}
```

Each reference object can have:
- `doi` — DOI string (ArXiv DOIs like `10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX` auto-convert to ArXiv IDs)
- `arxiv` — ArXiv ID (e.g. `"2305.14325"`)
- `title` — Paper title (used for search/match when no DOI/ArXiv)
- `author` — First author last name (for cleaner citation key)
- `year` — Publication year (int, for citation key)

At least one of `doi`, `arxiv`, or `title` is required per reference.

### Output format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bib_text": "@inproceedings{Vaswani2017, ...}\n\n@article{Wei2022, ...}",
  "total": 3,
  "found": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "entries": [{"citation_key": "Vaswani2017", "bibtex": "...", "title": "...", "doi": "...", "arxiv": ""}],
  "failed": []
}
```

### Workflow

1. Collect DOIs, ArXiv IDs, or titles for all papers you need to cite
2. Call `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with the full list in **one call**
3. Save `bib_text` from the response to your `references.bib` file
4. Check `failed` — for any missed papers, follow the **fallback procedure** below

### Fallback for failed references (MANDATORY)

NEVER fabricate BibTeX. For each failed reference:
1. **WebSearch** for `"Title" author year` (try `site:arxiv.org` too)
2. **WebFetch** the paper page → extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/ArXiv ID
3. If DOI/ArXiv found → retry `aii_semscholar_bib__fetch` with it
4. Last resort: write BibTeX by hand using **only verified info from the actual paper page**

### CLI (for manual use / debugging)

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-semscholar-bib" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_semscholar_bib__fetch.py --refs '[
  {"doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762", "author": "Vaswani", "year": 2017},
  {"arxiv": "2201.11903", "author": "Wei", "year": 2022},
  {"title": "Tree of Thoughts", "author": "Yao", "year": 2023}
]'
```

`--json, -j` — output raw JSON instead of .bib text

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
