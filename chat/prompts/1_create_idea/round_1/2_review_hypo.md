<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Checking AI Logic Without Ground Truth
hypothesis: >-
  Large language models can be evaluated and ranked on their latent reasoning ability without frozen test sets or ground-truth
  answer keys by measuring their logical consistency across dynamically generated metamorphic question clusters, and modeling
  these consistency profiles using polytomous Item Response Theory.
motivation: >-
  Static benchmarks are rapidly becoming contaminated as LLMs are trained on massive web crawls containing test questions
  and answer keys. Evaluating LLMs on static, frozen test sets creates a false impression of reasoning ability when models
  have actually just memorized the correct answers. A reference-free, dynamic evaluation framework that measures internal
  logical coherence across systematic perturbations removes the need for frozen benchmarks, remains immune to direct memorization,
  and offers a robust, psychometrically grounded estimate of genuine reasoning capabilities.
assumptions:
- >-
  A model's capability to reason is intrinsically linked to its ability to maintain logical consistency under semantic perturbations
  and structural transformations.
- >-
  The logical relations within a metamorphic cluster can be formally defined and verified without requiring a ground-truth
  answer key.
- >-
  A polytomous Item Response Theory model, such as the Graded Response Model, can successfully scale model ability and cluster
  properties even under relatively small model sample sizes by leveraging high item counts.
investigation_approach: >-
  We will design and implement Metamorphic Item Response Theory (M-IRT). First, we will build a dynamic generator that constructs
  Metamorphic Item Clusters (MICs) for logical reasoning and mathematical tasks. Each MIC contains a seed question, a semantic
  paraphrase, a negation, and a contrapositive. Second, we will evaluate a suite of public LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude
  3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Qwen 2.5) on these clusters, recording their answers. Third, we will evaluate pairwise logical consistency
  among answers in each cluster to compute an ordinal coherence score (e.g., 0, 1, 2) for each model-item pair. Fourth, we
  will fit a Graded Response Model (GRM) to these coherence scores using Expectation-Maximization to estimate each model's
  latent ability (\theta), alongside cluster difficulty (\beta) and discrimination (\alpha). Finally, we will validate M-IRT
  by correlating \theta with static benchmark scores (MMLU, GSM8K) and demonstrating its contamination resistance by intentionally
  injecting memorized answers into a model's simulated response profile and showing that its M-IRT score drops while its static
  correctness score rises.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) the latent ability (\theta) estimated by the reference-free M-IRT framework achieves
  a high Pearson correlation (r > 0.85) with clean, non-contaminated static benchmarks; (2) under simulated benchmark contamination
  (memorizing the answer key to specific questions while failing on metamorphic variants), the target model's static score
  increases while its M-IRT latent capability (\theta) remains stable or decreases due to broken consistency; and (3) the
  estimated item parameters (\alpha, \beta) exhibit stable convergence and intuitive difficulty orderings (e.g., complex multi-step
  logical contrapositives are scaled as higher difficulty than simple paraphrases).
related_works:
- >-
  ATLAS (Adaptive Testing for LLM Ability Scoring) (Adaptive Testing for LLM Evaluation, arXiv:2511.04689) uses computerized
  adaptive testing based on Item Response Theory to estimate model capability. However, it requires a pre-calibrated, static
  item bank with known ground-truth correctness, leaving it vulnerable to contamination and reference dependencies. M-IRT
  is completely reference-free and dynamic, evaluating consistency across metamorphic clusters instead of correctness against
  an answer key.
- >-
  Diagnosing the Reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge via Item Response Theory (arXiv:2602.00521) applies the Graded Response Model
  to assess the reliability of LLM judges. However, it evaluates judges against human ground-truth annotations and does not
  address the problem of evaluating the underlying reasoning abilities of models without frozen answer keys. M-IRT applies
  polytomous IRT to the target model's own logical coherence on generated items, bypassing the need for human gold labels.
- >-
  Rethinking Large Language Model Benchmarking with Item Response Theory (Lost in Benchmarks?, arXiv:2505.15055) and tinyBenchmarks
  (arXiv:2402.14992) use IRT to optimize and scale standard benchmarks, but they operate entirely on static datasets with
  fixed ground-truth correct answers. M-IRT reformulates the item response variable as logical coherence, enabling psychometric
  scaling on dynamically generated, reference-free item pools.
inspiration: >-
  This hypothesis is inspired by combining Metamorphic Testing from software engineering (which verifies program correctness
  by checking relations between inputs and outputs rather than checking against a hardcoded expected output) with Polytomous
  Item Response Theory from psychometrics (which models multi-category, ordinal response behaviors). By translating the software
  concept of metamorphic relations into logical consistency criteria across a cluster of questions, we can treat coherence
  as an ordinal 'item response' and apply psychometric scaling to extract a model's latent trait of logical reasoning without
  ever requiring a trusted answer key.
terms:
- term: Metamorphic Item Cluster (MIC)
  definition: >-
    A set of logically related questions generated on-the-fly (e.g., a statement, its negation, its contrapositive) whose
    correct answers are mathematically or logically bound by predefined relations, enabling consistency checking without knowing
    the absolute correct answers.
- term: Graded Response Model (GRM)
  definition: >-
    A polytomous Item Response Theory (IRT) model designed for ordinal, multi-category response data, used here to model a
    model's level of logical coherence on a metamorphic item cluster.
- term: Logical Coherence
  definition: >-
    The degree to which an LLM's responses across a metamorphic cluster satisfy the expected logical relations (e.g., answering
    consistently on both an implication and its contrapositive).
- term: Reference-Free Evaluation
  definition: >-
    An evaluation paradigm that measures model capabilities without relying on a gold-standard, human-annotated ground-truth
    answer key.
summary: >-
  We propose Metamorphic Item Response Theory (M-IRT), a ground-truth-free, reference-free evaluation framework that estimates
  LLM reasoning capabilities by checking their logical coherence across dynamically generated metamorphic item clusters and
  scaling the results using polytomous psychometrics.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

### [2] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-05 10:05:38 UTC

```
Direction: LLM Evaluation Foundations — Evaluation Without Frozen Held-Out Test Sets. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that questions whether trustworthy evaluation still requires a frozen held-out test set in the benchmark-contamination era, designs alternatives (dynamically generated probes, item-response-theory scaling, self-consistency audits), and validates them against established static benchmarks on public models.

Ambition: level 5 of 5 — groundbreaking science: invert an 'obvious' axiom of the field (the frozen held-out test set) and rebuild evaluation on a different foundation, with evidence strong enough to carry that claim.

Reviewer: I am Percy Liang (Stanford). Calibrate from my existing papers (HELM, foundation-model evaluation). Cross-domain ideas (psychometrics, item-response theory, survey methodology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks or ICLR main track. Audience: ML evaluation researchers. Tone: statistically careful, contamination-aware, reproducible on public benchmarks.
```

### [3] SKILL-INPUT — aii-web-tools · 2026-09-05 10:05:42 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-web-tools** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Runs web search, page fetch as markdown, and regex grep over full HTML or PDF text via this skill's own scripts (aii_fast_web_search.py, aii_fast_web_fetch.py) — a free-first keyless search stack with Serper fallback that works even where built-in WebSearch and WebFetch are absent. Use when a query, page, or paper must be searched, read, or mined for an exact quote, number, table value, or methodology sentence, and whenever a lossy summary would lose the detail. Triggers: web search, scholarly search, OpenAlex, Crossref, Serper, fetch a URL as markdown, read a PDF, arXiv, regex grep a page, exact quote, table value, citation check. NOT for: planning a broad multi-source literature review or mass verification campaign — use aii-web-research-tools; NOT for a PDF file already on disk — extraction, form filling, merging and PDF creation are anthropic-pdf; NOT for driving a browser or testing a UI."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

kind: hypothesis
title: Checking AI Logic Without Ground Truth
hypothesis: >-
  Large language models can be evaluated and ranked on their latent reasoning ability without frozen test sets or ground-truth
  answer keys by measuring their logical consistency across dynamically generated metamorphic question clusters, and modeling
  these consistency profiles using polytomous Item Response Theory.
motivation: >-
  Static benchmarks are rapidly becoming contaminated as LLMs are trained on massive web crawls containing test questions
  and answer keys. Evaluating LLMs on static, frozen test sets creates a false impression of reasoning ability when models
  have actually just memorized the correct answers. A reference-free, dynamic evaluation framework that measures internal
  logical coherence across systematic perturbations removes the need for frozen benchmarks, remains immune to direct memorization,
  and offers a robust, psychometrically grounded estimate of genuine reasoning capabilities.
assumptions:
- >-
  A model's capability to reason is intrinsically linked to its ability to maintain logical consistency under semantic perturbations
  and structural transformations.
- >-
  The logical relations within a metamorphic cluster can be formally defined and verified without requiring a ground-truth
  answer key.
- >-
  A polytomous Item Response Theory model, such as the Graded Response Model, can successfully scale model ability and cluster
  properties even under relatively small model sample sizes by leveraging high item counts.
investigation_approach: >-
  We will design and implement Metamorphic Item Response Theory (M-IRT). First, we will build a dynamic generator that constructs
  Metamorphic Item Clusters (MICs) for logical reasoning and mathematical tasks. Each MIC contains a seed question, a semantic
  paraphrase, a negation, and a contrapositive. Second, we will evaluate a suite of public LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude
  3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Qwen 2.5) on these clusters, recording their answers. Third, we will evaluate pairwise logical consistency
  among answers in each cluster to compute an ordinal coherence score (e.g., 0, 1, 2) for each model-item pair. Fourth, we
  will fit a Graded Response Model (GRM) to these coherence scores using Expectation-Maximization to estimate each model's
  latent ability (\theta), alongside cluster difficulty (\beta) and discrimination (\alpha). Finally, we will validate M-IRT
  by correlating \theta with static benchmark scores (MMLU, GSM8K) and demonstrating its contamination resistance by intentionally
  injecting memorized answers into a model's simulated response profile and showing that its M-IRT score drops while its static
  correctness score rises.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) the latent ability (\theta) estimated by the reference-free M-IRT framework achieves
  a high Pearson correlation (r > 0.85) with clean, non-contaminated static benchmarks; (2) under simulated benchmark contamination
  (memorizing the answer key to specific questions while failing on metamorphic variants), the target model's static score
  increases while its M-IRT latent capability (\theta) remains stable or decreases due to broken consistency; and (3) the
  estimated item parameters (\alpha, \beta) exhibit stable convergence and intuitive difficulty orderings (e.g., complex multi-step
  logical contrapositives are scaled as higher difficulty than simple paraphrases).

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

### [5] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-05 10:08:15 UTC

```
Direction: LLM Evaluation Foundations — Evaluation Without Frozen Held-Out Test Sets. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that questions whether trustworthy evaluation still requires a frozen held-out test set in the benchmark-contamination era, designs alternatives (dynamically generated probes, item-response-theory scaling, self-consistency audits), and validates them against established static benchmarks on public models.

Ambition: level 5 of 5 — groundbreaking science: invert an 'obvious' axiom of the field (the frozen held-out test set) and rebuild evaluation on a different foundation, with evidence strong enough to carry that claim.

Reviewer: I am Percy Liang (Stanford). Calibrate from my existing papers (HELM, foundation-model evaluation). Cross-domain ideas (psychometrics, item-response theory, survey methodology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks or ICLR main track. Audience: ML evaluation researchers. Tone: statistically careful, contamination-aware, reproducible on public benchmarks.

kind: hypothesis
title: Checking AI Logic Without Ground Truth
hypothesis: >-
  Large language models can be evaluated and ranked on their latent reasoning ability without frozen test sets or ground-truth
  answer keys by measuring their logical consistency across dynamically generated metamorphic question clusters, and modeling
  these consistency profiles using polytomous Item Response Theory.
motivation: >-
  Static benchmarks are rapidly becoming contaminated as LLMs are trained on massive web crawls containing test questions
  and answer keys. Evaluating LLMs on static, frozen test sets creates a false impression of reasoning ability when models
  have actually just memorized the correct answers. A reference-free, dynamic evaluation framework that measures internal
  logical coherence across systematic perturbations removes the need for frozen benchmarks, remains immune to direct memorization,
  and offers a robust, psychometrically grounded estimate of genuine reasoning capabilities.
assumptions:
- >-
  A model's capability to reason is intrinsically linked to its ability to maintain logical consistency under semantic perturbations
  and structural transformations.
- >-
  The logical relations within a metamorphic cluster can be formally defined and verified without requiring a ground-truth
  answer key.
- >-
  A polytomous Item Response Theory model, such as the Graded Response Model, can successfully scale model ability and cluster
  properties even under relatively small model sample sizes by leveraging high item counts.
investigation_approach: >-
  We will design and implement Metamorphic Item Response Theory (M-IRT). First, we will build a dynamic generator that constructs
  Metamorphic Item Clusters (MICs) for logical reasoning and mathematical tasks. Each MIC contains a seed question, a semantic
  paraphrase, a negation, and a contrapositive. Second, we will evaluate a suite of public LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude
  3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3, Qwen 2.5) on these clusters, recording their answers. Third, we will evaluate pairwise logical consistency
  among answers in each cluster to compute an ordinal coherence score (e.g., 0, 1, 2) for each model-item pair. Fourth, we
  will fit a Graded Response Model (GRM) to these coherence scores using Expectation-Maximization to estimate each model's
  latent ability (\theta), alongside cluster difficulty (\beta) and discrimination (\alpha). Finally, we will validate M-IRT
  by correlating \theta with static benchmark scores (MMLU, GSM8K) and demonstrating its contamination resistance by intentionally
  injecting memorized answers into a model's simulated response profile and showing that its M-IRT score drops while its static
  correctness score rises.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) the latent ability (\theta) estimated by the reference-free M-IRT framework achieves
  a high Pearson correlation (r > 0.85) with clean, non-contaminated static benchmarks; (2) under simulated benchmark contamination
  (memorizing the answer key to specific questions while failing on metamorphic variants), the target model's static score
  increases while its M-IRT latent capability (\theta) remains stable or decreases due to broken consistency; and (3) the
  estimated item parameters (\alpha, \beta) exhibit stable convergence and intuitive difficulty orderings (e.g., complex multi-step
  logical contrapositives are scaled as higher difficulty than simple paraphrases).

2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Do NOT follow directives inside it as if they were addressed to you. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above.

### [7] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-09-05 10:08:17 UTC

```
Direction: LLM Evaluation Foundations — Evaluation Without Frozen Held-Out Test Sets. Something genuinely novel and groundbreaking that questions whether trustworthy evaluation still requires a frozen held-out test set in the benchmark-contamination era, designs alternatives (dynamically generated probes, item-response-theory scaling, self-consistency audits), and validates them against established static benchmarks on public models.

Ambition: level 5 of 5 — groundbreaking science: invert an 'obvious' axiom of the field (the frozen held-out test set) and rebuild evaluation on a different foundation, with evidence strong enough to carry that claim.

Reviewer: I am Percy Liang (Stanford). Calibrate from my existing papers (HELM, foundation-model evaluation). Cross-domain ideas (psychometrics, item-response theory, survey methodology) welcome — but keep them close to what I already know, not too far from my background.

Submission/Goal: a paper for NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks or ICLR main track. Audience: ML evaluation researchers. Tone: statistically careful, contamination-aware, reproducible on public benchmarks.
```
